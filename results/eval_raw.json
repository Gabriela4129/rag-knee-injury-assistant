    "answer": "According to the context, when the ACL tears, the person typically feels the knee go out of joint and often hears or feels a \"pop\". If they try to stand on the leg, the knee may feel unstable and give out. The knee usually swells a great deal immediately (within two hours). Over the next several hours, pain becomes more severe and it becomes difficult to walk [Source 2].\n\nIn contrast, meniscus tears often present with symptoms such as joint line tenderness, clicking or locking sensations, and limited range of motion [Source 1]. The symptoms may not be as dramatic as those associated with an ACL tear, but they can still significantly impact knee function and stability.\n\nNote: I did not find any specific information in the provided context that directly compares the typical symptoms of an ACL tear to a meniscus tear. However, based on general knowledge and the provided sources, I have attempted to provide a concise answer.",

However, it is noted that knee MRI may be indicated in selected patients with refractory symptoms or in the presence of 'warning flags' or localized symptoms indicating rarer disease that needs to be ruled out, e.g., osteonecrosis.\n\nIn terms of ACL injuries (Source 2), there is no specific mention of red-flag symptoms that would require urgent referral. However, it is mentioned that aspiration of the knee may be considered in acutely injured knees with painful, tense effusions, but this decision is based on clinical opinion rather than reliable evidence.\n\nFor meniscus tears (Source 3 and Source 4), there is no specific mention of red-flag symptoms that would require urgent referral. However, it is noted that patients with mechanical symptoms may benefit from early arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) if they have significant mechanical symptoms and a clear physical exam.\n\nIn summary, while there are some general guidelines mentioned for the assessment and management of knee injuries, there are no specific \"red-flag\" symptoms identified that would require urgent referral.",

These goals include good control and minimal/no pain with functional movements, including step up/down, squat, partial lunge (between 0° and 60° of knee flexion), as well as maintaining a low level of pain (<3) during and after exercise.\n\nIn general, it is recommended to avoid high-impact sports until the patient has achieved sufficient neuromuscular control and proprioception to safely perform these activities. This may involve a phased approach, starting with low-velocity, single-plane activities and gradually progressing to more complex movements [Source 2].",

    "answer": "According to the AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline – Management of ACL Injuries (2022), group consensus suggests that age is an important consideration when deciding between treatment options for ACL tears. For example, a study conducted in young military personnel favored surgical reconstruction (Dunn, 2004). This implies that younger patients may be more likely to benefit from surgical treatment.\n\nAdditionally, the guideline notes that while there is no significant difference in return to activity based on three low-quality studies comparing operative and non-operative treatment options for ACL tears after reconstruction (Kovalak, 2018; Wellsandt, 2018; Wellsandt, 2020), age may still play a role in treatment choice. However, the guideline does not provide specific guidance on how age influences treatment choice, leaving clinicians to consider individual patient factors and make informed decisions based on their experience with conservative management and surgical options.

    "question": "What complications should clinicians monitor after knee surgery?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided sources, clinicians should monitor for complications such as symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (4.13 events per 1000 procedures) [Source 1], pulmonary embolism, infection, and death after knee surgery.
